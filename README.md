# VBA Project: Stock Market Analysis

# Introduction

For this project, I utilized VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. The goal was to create a script capable of processing stocks for a given year and extracting key metrics, including the ticker symbol, yearly change in stock prices, percentage change, and total stock volume. Additionally, I enhanced the script to identify stocks with the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume." Furthermore, I optimized the VBA script to run seamlessly across multiple worksheets, enabling analysis for every year at once.

# Features

Stock Analysis Script: Developed a VBA script to iterate through stock data, extracting vital information such as ticker symbols, yearly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volumes.

Enhanced Functionality: Implemented additional functionality within the script to identify stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.

Efficient Automation: Optimized the VBA script to execute on every worksheet, streamlining the analysis process for multiple years of data.
